Compiling slrn from source requires a C compiler that supports C89 or
later constructs.  Most C compilers that are currently in use provide
such support.  If you do not have such a C compiler, then download and
install the GNU compiler gcc from <http://gcc.gnu.org>.

slrn makes extensive use of version 2.X of the S-Lang programmer's
library.  You will need to have this library *and* its components
(slsh+modules) installed before you can build slrn.  See
<http://www.jedsoft.org/slang/> for links to the library.

This version of slrn has been tested on Unix and Windows systems.  The
code contains support for OS/2 and VMS but will most likely require
additional tweaks to get it running.  While it may compile without
difficulty on Mac OS X, it has not been tested on that platform.

To build slrn on a Unix platform (including cygwin), see
doc/INSTALL.unix.  For a windows platform, see doc/INSTALL.w32.
