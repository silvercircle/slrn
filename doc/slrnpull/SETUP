This file indicates how to setup slrnpull for pulling groups from a
news server.

0.  Build slrn and slrnpull.  On Unix, using ./configure --with-slrnpull
    makes sure slrnpull is built and the needed features are compiled into
    slrn.  On Windows, you need to "make slrnpull.exe" explicitly.
    
1.  Choose a directory that will be used for slrnpull.  In this file,
    I will assume it is /var/spool/slrnpull.
    
2.  Create the directory:

       mkdir /var/spool/slrnpull
       
    The --with-slrnpull option allows a different directory to be
    used.  /var/spool/slrnpull is the default value.

3.  Create a file called `slrnpull.conf' in that directory.  Use the
    example provided in the slrn/slrnpull distribution as a template:
    
      cp ./slrnpull.conf /var/spool/slrnpull
      EDIT /var/spool/slrnpull/slrnpull.conf
      
    You must edit this file!!  slrnpull will only retrieve the groups
    that are listed in this file.  It will NOT look at your newsrc file!
    
    If your server requires authorization information, create a file called 
    `authinfo' in the slrnpull directory.  The file should consist of
    two lines: the first line should contain the username and the
    second should contain the password.
  
4.  Startup your network connection, e.g.,

      ppp-up

5.  Run slrnpull.

      slrnpull -d /var/spool/slrnpull -h YOUR.NNTP.NEWS.SERVER
   
    Note that slrnpull runs with the umask of the process that created
    it.  If you run it from a shell script, it is a good idea to add
    
       umask 022
       
    before running slrnpull.  That way, the files that it creates will
    have read permissions for all users.

6.  Stop your internet connection, e.g.,

      ppp-down
      
7.  Add the following lines to the end of your .slrnrc file (change
    accordingly):

       set spool_inn_root	"/var/spool/slrnpull"
       set spool_root		"/var/spool/slrnpull/news"
       set spool_nov_root	"/var/spool/slrnpull/news"
       set use_slrnpull 1
       set read_active 1
       set server_object 	"spool"       
       hostname "YOUR_HOST_NAME"
       username "YOUR_USER_NAME"
       
8.  Now run slrn to read from this spool:

       slrn --spool
       
    (You can compile slrn so that it will read from the spool by
    default without the need to use the --spool command line option.
    See slrnfeat.h.)
