The slrn documentation in this directory is written in text-macro
format.  This format was invented by me and currently can only be
processed by the jed text editor and the tm2txt program that is
distributed with the S-Lang library.  In fact, ../slrnfuns.txt was
created from slrnfuns.tm via tm2txt.  The jed editor converts the .tm
source to SGML and from there it is converted to other formats, e.g.,
html, via SGML-Tools.

The advantage of text-macro over SGML is that I believe it is much
easier to write in text-macro than in raw SGML.  In fact, the text-macro
source is much easier to comprehend than SGML.  For example, the
\function macro allows the text-macro source to look like

    \function{bla bla}
        .
	.
    \done

whereas the equivalent SGML source would look like:

    <sect><bf>bla bla</bf><label id="bla bla"><p><descrip>
        .
	.
    </descrip><p>

Of course this is possible because \function is a macro defined via

   #d function#1 <sect><bf>$1</bf>\label{$1}}<descrip>

(Note that `\label' is another macro) Now suppose that I wanted the
section to appear in some other font, e.g., <tt>.  Then it is only
necessary to make the change to the function macro:

   #d function#1 <sect><tt>$1</tt>\label{$1}}<descrip>
