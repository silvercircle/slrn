I want to thank everybody who helped to develop and improve slrn by
sending in code, bugreports or leading productive discussions.  The
list of contributors is far too long to be kept in this file; please
see changes.txt for those who contributed patches.

I am particularly grateful to the earliest users and contributers to
software.  The earliest contributers to slrn include:

  Michael Elkins
  Matthias Friedrich
  David Gerard
  Howard Goldstein
  Andrew Greer
  Sven Guckes
  Jan Hlavacek
  Jay Maynard
  J.B. Nicholson-Owens
  Mark Olesen
  Felix Schueller
  Thomas Schultz
  Lloyd Zusman

In 2001 I no longer found time to continue slrn development.  Thomas
Schultz agreed to take over the job as the lead slrn developer and
continued in that role until 2008.  For this reason he deserves
special recognition.

In 2008 I returned as the lead slrn developer.  I was helped by an
enthusiastic group of folks who took it upon themselves to bring the
documentation up to date:

  Peter J Ross
  Rudy Taraschi
  Thomas Wiegner

Finally, I would like to thank Andrew Strong for his support of slrn
under Windows.
